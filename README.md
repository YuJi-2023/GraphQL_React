# GraphQL Learning Project

This project is designed as a hands-on learning journey to explore GraphQL. The goal is to document and understand the GraphQL development process by building a full stack application, starting with the backend server setup and then connecting it to a React frontend.

## Project Goals

1. **Learn GraphQL Basics**: Understand the fundamentals of GraphQL and how it differs from REST.
2. **Build a GraphQL Server**: Set up a GraphQL server using Node.js, Express, and the GraphQL library.
3. **Develop a React Frontend**: Create a React application that interacts with the GraphQL server.
4. **Document the Journey**: Record key learnings, challenges, and tips encountered along the way.

## Project Structure

1. **Backend**:

   - Create a GraphQL server using Node and Express.
   - Set up and configure GraphQL schema, queries, and mutations.
   - Implement data fetching and manipulation with sample data.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Set up a React app with Apollo Client to connect to the GraphQL server.
   - Develop a UI to interact with GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
